<h2>Auto completion</h2>
<p>
	While typing, press <code>ctrl+space</code> to open a popup with a list of all labels that match
	the previous chars to complete and insert a label name. If you did not already started typing before
	pressing <code>ctrl+space</code>, all available labels will be shown in the popup. Press <code>Enter</code>
	or mouse click on a label to insert it or complete your input.
</p>

<h2>Drag &amp; drop</h2>
<p>
	You can drag &amp; drop files from the file explorer (or finder, nautilus, etc.) into
        the editor area to either open them or include them into your source. The drop operation
        depends on which modifier keys (<code>shift</code> and <code>control</code>) you hold
        down while dropping the selected file(s).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Without pressing and holding <code>shift</code> and <code>control</code> keys
        <ul>
            <li>Assembler files (with file extension <code>.a</code> or <code>.asm</code>) will be opened.</li>
            <li>
                Binary or files files (with file extension <code>.bin</code>, <code>.c64</code> or <code>.txt</code>) will be included via 
                <code>!bin</code>, <code>.import</code> or <code>.binary</code> directive (depending on the assembler).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Pressing and holding the <code>control</code> key
        <ul>
            <li>
                Assembler files (with file extension <code>.a</code> or <code>.asm</code>) will be included via
                <code>!src</code>, <code>.import</code> or <code>.binclude</code> directive (depending on the assembler).
            </li>
            <li>
                Binary or files files (with file extension <code>.bin</code>, <code>.c64</code> or <code>.txt</code>) will be included as
                byte table (see function <em>Insert bytes from file</em> in Source menu).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Pressing and holding both <code>shift</code> and <code>control</code> keys
        <ul>
            <li>
                The file path in quotes will be inserted at the caret position.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="filemenu">File menu</a></h1>

<p>
    This menu includes typical file operations like opening, saving and closing files.
    Note that the latest ten recent files can be opened quickly via the <em>Recent files</em>
    submenu, and that the associated compiler and user script settings will be restored
    automatically when opening a recent document.
</p>

<br>
<h1><a name="editmenu">Edit menu</a></h1>

<p>
    This menu contains the default edit operations like cut, copy, paste, but also undo
    and redo.
</p>

<br>
<h1><a name="findmenu">Find menu</a></h1>

<p>
    Contains all find and replace operation for current active documents. Both the
    <em>Find searchterm</em> and the <em>Replace</em> command will open an edit
    field below the source code window where find and replace terms can be edited.
</p>

<p>
    The <em>Find searchterm</em> function also accepts <em>regular expressions</em>.
</p>

<p>
    Use buttons beside the text fields or menu shortcuts / hotkeys to jump to
    the next or previous occurence of a searchterm.
</p>

<h2>The Goto-commands</h2>
<p>
    Except for the <em>Goto line</em> command, each of the <em>goto</em> commands opens the
    drop down list at the bottom of the window. The content of this list depends on the context,
    i.e. the command that opened this list. The <em>Goto label</em> command, for instance,
    extracts <strong>all labels</strong> from <strong>all currently opened</strong> files
    and lists them in the drop down list. A red heading with the related file name indicates
    to which file the labels from this list belong. Selecting an item will choose the related
    file and scrolls the caret to the line containing the label.
</p>

<p>
    The <em>Goto function</em> or <em>Goto macro</em> command work in a similar way, just that
    the drop down list contains all functions or macros found in all opened files.
</p>

<p>
    The <em>Goto section</em> command lets you choose any section to jump. Section are
    specific comments on the source code, which can be used to structure your source. See 
    <a href="#sourcemenu">Source menu</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
    The <em>Goto line</em> command sets the input focus into the text field at the bottom left part,
    where you can enter any line number. Then the content will scroll to this line.
</p>

<br>

<h2>The Jump-commands</h2>
<p>
    Unlike the <em>Goto</em> commands, which scroll to <em>a specific label, function, macro...</em> etc., 
    the <em>Jump</em> commands scroll to the next, respectively to the previous occurence of a label, 
    section or error. <em>Next</em> and <em>previous</em> relate to the current caret position.
</p>

<p>
    While the <em>Jump to next/prev label</em> and <em>Jump to next/prev section</em> commands only work when you have
    labels or sections defined in your source, the <em>Jump to next/prev error</em> command only works after
    you have compiled a source file that contains errors. In case the assembler stops parsing your
    source code due to errors, the <em>Compiler log</em> is shown and you can cycle through all
    errors with the <em>Jump to next/prev error</em> command.
</p>

<p>
    The <em>Jump to label</em> command only works when the caret (cursor) is positioned over a label inside
    your source code. The command will then scroll to the line where this label is defined.
</p>

<br>
<h1><a name="sourcemenu">Source menu</a></h1>

<h2>Running and selecting scripts</h2>

<p>
    Running and selecting scripts are menu commands that execute the same as clicking the <em>Run</em>
    button or selecting an item from the drop down list of the <em>Compile and Run</em> area
    in the main window.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Run script</em> command runs the currently selected user script. User script are commands that
    you would typically type into the console or terminal in order to run compilers, crunchers or emulators.
    With these scripts you can execute your compiler, cruncher and emulator in order to compile your source
    code and watch the compiled file in an emulator.
</p>
<p>
    You can set up as much different scripts as you want in order to get various compile and run options.
    Please refere to the preferences, select the <em>Compile &amp; Run</em> tab and click on the help 
    button for details on user scripts.
</p>

<p>
    With the <em>Select script</em> command the input focus is set to the drop down list with all
    user scripts. This is a convenience command for quickly switching between scripts using the
    keyboard.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Select syntax scheme</em> lets you switch between different compiler syntax schemes (e.g.
    the KickAss syntax differs from ACME and 64tass) in order to correctly highlight keywords,
    comments, compiler directives etc.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Toggle and insert commands</h2>

<p>
    The <em>Toggle comment</em> command comments or uncomments the current selection. Note that this
    command only works when text is selected.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Insert section</em> inserts a specific command line with a named label, which can be used
    to structure your source and easily navigate through it (see <a href="#navigatemenu">Navigate menu</a>).
    <em>Insert separator</em> inserts a simple commented dashed line as separator.
</p>

<p>
    The <em>Insert Basic start</em> command adds a short asm code snippet that adds a Basic line to
    the compiled source code with a Sys-command to start your code.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Inserts bytes from file</em> reads a file byte-wise and insert all bytes of that file as
    byte-table. The <em>Insert sinus table</em> command opens an input window where you can specifiy
    parameters for computing a sinus curve, which will be inserted as byte-table into your source.
</p>

<br>
<h1><a name="viewmenu">View menu</a></h1>

<p>
    With the commands of the View menu, it is possible to switch the position and layout of the log windows
    and the Compile and Run area. Furthermore, you can quickly show one of the log windows.
</p>
